Hello:
The SoCal RUG is holding its 6th Data Hackathon. During this weekend-long event, students, and professionals will be able to work together to hack on an interesting data set. Historically, your group members have attended our event and have had a great time and sharpened their skills. Would you please forward the following information to them. We also have a flyer that you can post that would be very helpful. We would also encourage you to cross post the event to your meetup group. If you have a newsletter, we would kindly ask that you announce it there.

Thank You
John Peach

Are you interested in sharpening your data skills, playing games, winning prizes, working with data professionals, gaining bragging rights, adding experience to your resume, and most importantly having fun? Check out the SoCal RUG Data Hackathon.

It is April and that means Data Hackathon!!! SoCal RUG and the Merage Analytics Club will be hosting its 6th Data Hackathon. It is an in person event that will take place on the weekend of 2023-04-22 to 2023-05-23. During this weekend-long event, you will be able to take a half day tutorial in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It will be taught by Emil Hvitfeldt who literally wrote the book on NLP and is a software engineer at Posit (formally, RStudio).  During the data hackathon portion you will work in a team to hack on a rich dataset and develop insights. There will be a mix of seasoned professionals and people that are just starting out. This will be a great way to network while having fun and learning. You can use any data tools that you want during the event (i.e. R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Looker, pen and paper, abacus, slide ruler) There will be data science experts available throughout the event to give you a hand and guide you through the process. Plus, there will be some games and plenty of prizes too.

The event's repository has more information, things like the schedule, meals (yup they are included), resources, judging criteria, and much more. It is updated frequently.

The event has sold out the last 5-years and we expect to sell-out again this year. So, sign-up early.
