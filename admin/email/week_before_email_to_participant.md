# SoCal RUG 2023-04 Hackathon Preparation

## Pre-hackathon Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event. Please read the entire email. There are a number of things to do.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/README.md) file for the event.
1. SoCal RUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [SoCal RUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. 
    1. If you are not on the [SoCal RUG Slack channel](https://socalrug.slack.com) please [sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-invite3).
    1. Join the **hackathon-2023-04** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the hackathon.
1. Information for the hackathon is kept in the [hackathon-2023-04](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*, have an ssh key and a GitHub account. The following section will help you do that.
    1. You will need *git* installed. In Windows, it is referred to as **GitBash**. See [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for instructions.
    1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you do not have one.
    1. You will need an *ssh key*. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create one. Make sure you choose your OS at the top.
    1. Your *ssh key* needs to be registered in your GitHub account. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your public *ssh key* to your GitHub account. Make sure you choose your OS at the top. 
    1. Clone the hackathon repo. Go to a command line terminal (Linux/Mac) or *GitBash* in Windows. There are two ways to do this, do **not** use the *https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04.git* URL. Instead, use the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:socalrug/hackathon-2023-04.git
```
1. Run the [check_setup.r](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/master/check_setup.r) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. **This can take quite a while to run**.
