# SoCal RUG Data Science Hackathon in Sold Out

Hello:

The hackathon is sold out and we have a waiting list. If you are not able to attend please let me know so that we can give your ticket to someone else. Unfortunately, Eventbrite does not allow us to issue a refund, at this point. However, we would like to have any many people attend as possible. So, if you are not able to attend, please let me know ASAP. You can email me at orangecounty.rug@gmail.com.

Thanks

John
