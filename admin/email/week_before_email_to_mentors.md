Dear mentors:

Thank you all for your support of our upcoming hackathon and for being mentors.  We are looking forward to having a great event this weekend!

I wanted to pass along some information:

The schedule of events is listed on the main page of the [hackathon GitHub repo](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04). When you arrive please locate one of the organizers to pick up your name badge. To mentor the participants, simply go to the different groups and introduce yourself. See the hackathon GitHub repo's main page for a list of rooms.

If you are mentoring on Sunday, the building will be locked. Please text me (802)735-2059 to open the front door.

Finally, [here](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) is information about parking. When you enter the parking structure, stay in the right lane and you can purchase a parking permit from the automated kiosk. Purchase a day pass for $13. Please take a picture of the parking pass and send that along with your mailing address and we will send you a check to reimburse you. Please send them to orangecounty.rug@gmail.com.

Thanks again and looking forward to seeing you this weekend.

John Peach
