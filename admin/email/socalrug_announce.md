Hello SoCal RUG:

** [Hackathon Sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2023-04) **

It is April, and this is no April fools joke, that means Data Hackathon!!! We will be hosting our 6th Data Hackathon. It is an in person event that will take place on the weekend of 2023-04-22 to 2023-05-23. During this weekend-long event, you will be able to take a half day tutorial in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It will be taught by Emil Hvitfeldt who literally wrote the book on NLP and is a software engineer at Posit (formally, RStudio).  During the data hackathon portion you will work in a team to hack on a rich dataset and develop insights. There will be a mix of seasoned professionals and people just starting out. This will be a great way to network while having fun and learning. You can use any data tools that you want during the event (i.e. R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, Looker, pen and paper, abacus, slide ruler) There will be data science experts available throughout the event to give you a hand and guide you through the process. Plus, there will be some games and plenty of prizes too.

The event's [repository](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04) has more information, things like the schedule, meals (yup they are included), resources, [judging criteria](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/admin/judging_guidelines.md), and much more. It is updated frequently.

The event has sold out the last 5-years and we expect to sell-out again this year. So, [sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2023-04) early.

There is a small fee, $35, for the event. This to help defray costs such as meals, snacks, prizes, etc. However, we would never want the cost to stand in the way of your fun. So, there is a limited number of tickets that we can hand-out to people with financial hardships. Email me at orangecounty.rug@gmail.com for details.

Cheers
John Peach
