I am one of the organizers of the Southern California R User Group (https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/) (formally OCRUG). Each year we host a very popular data science hackathon. Students and people from the community come together to hack on some data. I would like to ask you to be a judge for this event.

The goals of the hackathon are:
* The hackathon is primarily an educational event, not a competition. However, the hackathon is framed in the context of a light competition to provide overall structure, including team-based collaboration, the presentation of final work, judging, and prizes.
* Novice Users: provide an opportunity to work with a real-world data sets from start (acquire the data) to finish (produce a final “report” on the findings from their work).
* Experienced Users: provide an opportunity to practice data analysis skills in a structured environment, interact with others, and assist new users.

The teams will work throughout the weekend to develop their projects and present them at a final event. During the presentation you will assess them for a number of different prizes. This is the judging guidelines (https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/master/admin/judging_guidelines.md).

You are welcome to come to the event during the weekend but you would need to be there from 1:00 - 4:00 PM on 2023-04-23. The event will be held at Merage Business School at UC, Irvine.

I would be happy to answer any questions and looking forward to having you participate in this event.

Cheers
John Peach
