Dear judges:

Thank you all for your support of our upcoming hackathon and for being judges.  We are looking forward to having a great event this weekend!

I wanted to pass along some information:

When you have a moment, please read through the [judging guidelines]https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/admin/judging_guidelines.md(), which describes the different categories the teams will be judged on.


The schedule of events is listed on the main page of the [hackathon GitHub repo](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04).

Please plan to arrive at UCI by 1:00 PM on Sunday.  Teams will start their presentations at 1:30 PM, and everything should wrap up by 4 PM.  You are more than welcome to come at 12 PM if you'd like to have lunch with us.

On Sunday the building will be locked. Please text me (802)735-2059 to open the front door.

Finally, [here](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2023-04/blob/main/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) is information about parking. When you enter the parking structure, stay in the right lane and you can purchase a parking permit from the automated kiosk. Purchase a day pass for $13. Please take a picture of the parking pass and send that along with your mailing address and we will send you a check to reimburse you. Please send them to orangecounty.rug@gmail.

Let us know if you have any questions and thanks again for your support of the group and the event!

Thanks again and looking forward to seeing you this weekend.

John Peach
