Hello:

Thanks for your support of the upcoming hackathon and for presenting your tutorials this coming Saturday morning.

Please plan to arrive at least 30 min before the start of your tutorial. If you are teaching the first session, please allow a little extra time as the entrance into the parking structure can be backed up.

The schedule of tutorials is given below. Please confirm your session time:

* 09:15 - 10:45: Tommy Steed & Javier Orraca; dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2
* 11:00 - 12:30: Emil Hvitfeldt; tidymodels

You can see the full schedule on our GitHub repo: https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2022-04

We would like to put the presentation slides on our repo before the event if possible.  Please send them along to John at John@jppeach.com.  There is no problem if you have last-minute updates -- we can push those after the tutorials.

Please feel free to stay (or leave as it may be) throughout the weekend. We will have free snacks and lunch on both days.

Parking info is [here](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2022-04/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf). When you enter the parking structure, stay in the right lane and you can purchase a ticket at the automated kiosk. Purchase a day pass for $13. Please take a picture of the parking pass and send that along with your mailing address and we will send you a check to reimburse you. Please send them to Pablo at pablobarajasp@gmail.com.

Let us know if you have any questions and thanks again!

John Peach
